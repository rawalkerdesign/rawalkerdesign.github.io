   <p>I am interested in creating art that matters. 
   This means high quality work that inspires people. 
   I enjoy experimenting with mediums, techniques, and 
   styles in order to constantly push myself to improve my 
   skills. I never let a challenge get in my way of producing 
   good design work because I am committed first and foremost 
   to quality. Through my attention to detail, organizational 
   skills, and ability to take risks I hope to create art that 
   changes the world.  </p>
